For some time, the Skagit Council of Governments' (SCOG) Transportation Policy Board had questions around how populations were flowing in and out of Skagit County, WA. 
The [Skagitonians on the Move][skagit] infographic was produced for SCOG in 2018 and sought to educate the Policy Board and stakeholders around in- and out-migration in the Skagit County area. 

This infographic was produced in Adobe Illustrator.
