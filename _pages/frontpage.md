I'm Katie - a transportation planner working in the public sector. I have a background in environmental education and sustainable and resilient community development. I currently work for the [Washington State Department of Transportation's][wsdot] Northwest Region Mount Baker Area, serving communities in Whatcom, Skagit, and Island counties. 

This blog showcases some of the spatial analysis and data visualization projects I have developed during my time working in public transportation planning agencies.
